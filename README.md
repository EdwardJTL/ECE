ECE253 Digital and Computer Systems

Just all of my projects and labs from this course. Few of the files and/or lines of code are directly from the assignment
materials, so I would assume my prof wrote them. Otherwise, they should be my own :). 

Lab 2-6 are Verilog labs. The pin assignment file is in Lab2-3/Lab2/part1; it's the DE1_SoC.qsf provided by Altera.
Lab 7-10 are assembly labs. The .s files are in the folders.

Some of these were hard :). Lots of hours spent waiting for Quartus to compile in the lab (rip MacOS). The LEDs do bling tho.

PS: if you are a first year engsci, please don't steal my code. It will probably get both of us in trouble.
