ECE253 Digital and Computer Systems

Just all of my projects and labs from this course. Few of the files and/or lines of code are directly from the assignment
materials, so I would assume my prof wrote them. Otherwise, they should be my own :). 

Some of these were hard :). Lots of hours spent waiting for Quartus to compile in the lab (rip MacOS). The LEDs do bling tho.

PS: if you are a first year engsci, please don't steal my code. It will probably get both of us in trouble.
